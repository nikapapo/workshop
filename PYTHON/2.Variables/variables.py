# VARIABLES
# ========================================
# python is a "type-inferred" language:
# you don't have to explicity define the variables type

# Declare and assign values

website = "nikoloz.com"
#print(website)

# Assigning multiple values tu multiple variables 

a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"

# print (b)

#ASSIGN the same value to multiple variables

a = b = c = 8
c =3
